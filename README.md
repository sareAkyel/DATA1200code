# DATA1200code
**Code for educational use only**  
This is HTML and CSS written for [DATA1200](https://student.oslomet.no/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/DATA1200/2023/HØST). It is written with a specific, educational context in mind, and not all of it adheres to best-practice. You are free to download and play around with it! But you should be carefull using it as a basis *without* the lectures as a guide to what are examples of good, valid code rather than showcasing browser behaviour.   

## The three directories   
* basic
* flowerfarm
* scaling
 
The first is exactly that, attempts at showing just how simple HTML can be and still render.   
The second is a site with more complete and (hopefully!) only valid code.   
The last is a rather ugly attempt to demonstrate scaling with flex-boxes. There are guides to do this on [w3schools.org](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [developer.Mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), and several other places. My example code is just actual example code to play around with, rather than an introduction or guide to how (and why).   

***But there is a fourth directory?***   
— Ah, yes, all depending, there may be an "Interactive"-folder. As of now, this is a back-up in case I want to bridge DATA1200 into DATA1700 (JavaScript) that is taught in the spring semester. You should ignore this for now. I may forget to push changes if I work on this, as it is currently ***not*** in my plan.
